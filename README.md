# d77coreboot - own your laptop again!

d77coreboot repo is intended to provide a collection of functional Coreboot roms.

You can modify, study and use them freely, but I grant no warranty for bad use and giant paperweights; use it at your own risk.

For starting point, I believe, this collection of roms can be a good helper in the study of Coreboot and future development of your own roms for your laptops.

All of them were compiled by me for my personal use, and where it is not the case, I mention it providing "ownership" to the person responsible.

All of them are provided with vgarom enabled and with the Intel_ME disabled.

Explore the wiki and happy hacking.
